# Datatables
Datatables is an AMAZING library that lets you dynamically select and sort information from the client-side. Many, MANY websites use this plugin, and having it available in Budibase will make live data filtering much simpler.
This is listed as "V1.0" (eyeroll) but it's more like a 0.8 as it seems functional, but isn't fully deployed and tested.

# Description
DataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library. It is a highly flexible tool, built upon the foundations of progressive enhancement, that adds all of these advanced features to any HTML table.

## Instructions
As this data below is pretty minimalistic, here's the basics:

- Download local the "datatables-1.0.0.tar.gz".
- Load up your Budibase instance
- Navigate to "Plugins" / "Add Plugin" (**Not Github installation - that is untested presently**)
- "Add new plugin subpage", use the "Source" pulldown to select "File Upload"
- Upload the datatables-1.0.0.tar.gz

## Usage
The datatables has to be fed from a data provider. More notes coming as they are documented.
